Some of tasks done in this Repo([papers' dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-EhpZaY5gvbgNuEU5IskmlQ0EnNAG5cu/view?usp=drive_link)):
- Clean the texts in the title and abstract fields if needed. 
- Remove mathematical symbols, meaningless characters in the text, remove stopwords, etc. 
- Calculate the number of articles in each category (e.g., ph-hep or co.math).
- Identify the category that has the most articles.
- Analyze the distribution of the number of authors in each article.
